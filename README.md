*"Conversation as a platform (CaaP) is the future, so it's perfect that we're already offering the whole toolkits to our .NET developers using the Miravira AI BOT Platform Builder to build a CaaP. It opens up as much learning power as possible for your own robots and precisely control every step of the AI processing pipeline."*
    
**Miravira** is an open source machine learning framework for AI Bot platform builder. This project involves natural language understanding, computer vision and audio processing technologies, and aims to promote the development and application of intelligent robot assistants in information systems. Out-of-the-box machine learning algorithms allow ordinary programmers to develop artificial intelligence applications faster and easier. 

It's written in C# running on .Net Core that is full cross-platform framework, the plug-in and pipeline flow execution design is adopted to completely decouple the plug-ins. C# is a enterprise grade programming language which is widely used to code business logic in information management related system. More friendly to corporate developers. Miravira adopts machine learning algorithm in C# directly. That will facilitate the feature of the typed language C#, and be more easier when refactoring code in system scope. 

**Miravira** is in accordance with components principle strictly, decouples every part that is needed in the platform builder. So you can choose different UI/UX, or pick up a different LLM providers. They are all modulized based on unified interfaces. **Miravira** provides an advanced Agent abstraction layer to efficiently manage complex application scenarios in enterprises, allowing enterprise developers to efficiently integrate AI into business systems.
